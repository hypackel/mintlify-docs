## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll explore some essential HTML tags that help structure and enhance your web pages. We'll cover the `<center>`, `<div>`, and `<a>` tags, explaining their purpose and how to use them correctly.

## The `<center>` Tag

The `<center>` tag is used to center-align the content within its parent element.

**Warning:** This tag is not supported in all browsers and is considered deprecated. It's generally better to use CSS for styling instead.

```html
<center>
  This text will be centered.
</center>
```

## The `<div>` Tag

The `<div>` tag is a container used to divide up your code into sections. It doesn't have any inherent styling, but it's crucial for structuring your HTML and applying CSS or JavaScript.

- It does nothing unless CSS or JavaScript is added to it.
- Good code does not overuse divs but does not underuse divs. Think of it like groups of code that look good in these bunches.

```html
<div>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
  <p>Another paragraph inside the same div.</p>
</div>
```

## The `<a>` Tag

The `<a>` tag creates an anchor link, which is used to link to another page or website.

- `href` is the attribute you pass in to specify the destination URL.
- `target` is the attribute that specifies how the link should open:
    - `_blank` opens the link in a new tab.
    - `_self` opens the link in the same tab.

**Example:**

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>
```

**Result:**

<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>

## Your Task

1. Open the editor provided by the club.
2. Create a `div` element.
3. Inside the `div`, create a `center` element.
4. Inside the `center` element, add some text.
5. Create an `a` tag that links to your favorite website.
6. Make the link open in a new tab.

**Challenge:** Try nesting multiple `div` elements inside each other and see how it affects the layout.
