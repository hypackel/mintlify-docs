## Basic Data Types

JavaScript has several basic data types that we use to store different kinds of information:

### Strings (Text)
```javascript
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = 'Doe';
let message = `Hello there`;  // Template literal
```

### Numbers
```javascript
let age = 25;        // Integer
let price = 19.99;   // Decimal
let temperature = -5; // Negative number
```

## Practice Exercise 1: Working with Strings

Let's practice combining strings in different ways.

<Accordion title="🎯 Task">
Create two variables with your first and last name, then combine them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔍 Hint 1">
Use the + operator to join strings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔍 Hint 2">
Don't forget to add a space between names.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔍 Hint 3">
Try using both + operator and template literals.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="💡 Solution">
```html
<script>
  let firstName = "John";
  let lastName = "Doe";
  
  // Using + operator
  console.log(firstName + " " + lastName);
  
  // Using template literal
  console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);
</script>
```
</Accordion>

## Basic Math Operations

JavaScript can perform various mathematical operations:

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 5;

console.log(a + b);  // Addition: 15
console.log(a - b);  // Subtraction: 5
console.log(a * b);  // Multiplication: 50
console.log(a / b);  // Division: 2
```

## Practice Exercise 2: Calculator

Create a simple calculator that performs basic math operations.

<Accordion title="🎯 Task">
Create variables for two numbers and show the result of all basic math operations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔍 Hint 1">
Declare two number variables.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔍 Hint 2">
Use console.log to show each operation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔍 Hint 3">
Add labels to make the output clear.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="💡 Solution">
```html
<script>
  let num1 = 10;
  let num2 = 5;
  
  console.log("Addition: " + (num1 + num2));
  console.log("Subtraction: " + (num1 - num2));
  console.log("Multiplication: " + (num1 * num2));
  console.log("Division: " + (num1 / num2));
</script>
```
</Accordion>

## Type Checking

Use `typeof` to check what type of data you're working with:

```javascript
let name = "John";
let age = 25;

console.log(typeof name);  // "string"
console.log(typeof age);   // "number"
```

## Quick Tips

1. Strings must be wrapped in quotes
2. Numbers don't need quotes
3. Use template literals (backticks) for easier string formatting
4. Math operations between numbers and strings might not work as expected

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Adding numbers as strings ('2' + '2' = '22')
2. Forgetting to convert string input to numbers
3. Using mathematical operations with undefined variables
4. Not checking data types before operations

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `F12`: Open browser developer tools
- `Ctrl + K`: Clear console
- `Alt + ↑/↓`: Move line up/down
- `Ctrl + /`: Comment/uncomment line

In the next lesson, we'll learn about:
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Comparison operators
- Boolean values
- Making decisions in code

Remember to experiment with different data types and operations in the console!
