## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites interactive. While HTML provides structure and CSS handles styling, JavaScript adds behavior and functionality to web pages.

## Adding JavaScript to HTML

Since we're working with a single-file editor, we'll use the `<script>` tag to add JavaScript directly in our HTML:

```html
<script>
  // Your JavaScript code goes here
</script>
```

## Console Output

The console is a tool for developers to output messages and debug code. To see the console, press F12 in your browser and click on "Console".

```html
<script>
  console.log('Hello, World!');  // Outputs: Hello, World!
  console.log(42);              // Outputs: 42
</script>
```

## Practice Exercise 1: Your First JavaScript

Write your first JavaScript code using console.log.

<Accordion title="🎯 Task">
Output three different messages to the console.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔍 Hint 1">
Use console.log() for each message.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔍 Hint 2">
Try outputting different types of data (text, numbers).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔍 Hint 3">
Remember to put text inside quotes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="💡 Solution">
```html
<script>
  console.log('Welcome to JavaScript!');
  console.log(2023);
  console.log('Learning to code is fun!');
</script>
```
</Accordion>

## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data. We use `let` to declare variables that might change and `const` for values that won't change.

```javascript
let name = "John";          // A string variable
let age = 25;              // A number variable
const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;    // A constant value
```

## Practice Exercise 2: Working with Variables

Create and use some variables in JavaScript.

<Accordion title="🎯 Task">
Create variables for your name and age, then output them to the console.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔍 Hint 1">
Use let to declare your variables.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔍 Hint 2">
Remember to use quotes for text (strings).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔍 Hint 3">
Use console.log to output the variables.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="💡 Solution">
```html
<script>
  let myName = "Alex";
  let myAge = 15;
  
  console.log(myName);
  console.log(myAge);
  console.log("My name is " + myName + " and I am " + myAge + " years old.");
</script>
```
</Accordion>

## Quick Tips

1. JavaScript is case-sensitive (`name` and `Name` are different variables)
2. Always declare variables with `let` or `const`
3. Use meaningful variable names
4. End each statement with a semicolon
5. Use the console to check your outputs

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Forgetting to use quotes around text
2. Using variables before declaring them
3. Misspelling variable names
4. Forgetting to open the console to see outputs

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `F12`: Open browser developer tools
- `Ctrl + /`: Comment/uncomment line
- `Alt + ↑/↓`: Move line up/down
- `Ctrl + S`: Save your work
