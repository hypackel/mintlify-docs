In this club you will learn how to code websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
You will start with HTML, then CSS and then JavaScript.


## What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It is used to define the structure of a web page.

### Basic HTML Document

HTML is made up of elements. These elements are used to create the structure of a web page. Each element has a start tag, content, and an end tag.
The start tag is normally formatted like this: `<elementName>`. 
The end tag is formatted like this: `</elementName>` with a slash before the element name.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```


In further lessons we will learn about Emmet and how to code even faster.
All you need to know is that you can type `!` and then press `tab` or `enter` to get this boilerplate.


### Now to explain the basic HTML Document.

`<!DOCTYPE html>` is the doctype declaration. It tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document and not some other file.

`<html>` is the root element of the HTML document. It is the container for all the other elements of the document.

`<head>` is the head section of the HTML document. It contains information about the document like styles, scripts, and other meta-information (author, description, keywords, etc).

`<title>` is the title of the HTML document. It is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

`<body>` is the body section of the HTML document. It contains the content of the document.


## Your Task

1. Open your editor provided by the club. as the url may change.
2. type `!` and then press `tab` or `enter` to get the boilerplate.
3. Look at the code and make sure you understand it.
4. Create an h1 element with the text "Hello, World!" inside the body.
4. Try to change the h1 of the page to your name.
