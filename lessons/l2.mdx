## What is an h1 Heading?

The `<h1>` tag is the most important heading in HTML. It represents the main heading or title of a webpage. Search engines and screen readers give special importance to the h1 heading, making it crucial for both SEO and accessibility.

### Key Characteristics of h1

- It should be used only once per page
- Represents the primary topic or purpose of the page
- Typically the largest and most prominent heading

### h1 Example

```html
<h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>
```

## Headings from h1 to h6

HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. While `<h1>` is for the main title, the others are for subheadings and sections.

- `<h2>` is used for major sections
- `<h3>` is used for subsections
- `<h4>` to `<h6>` are for even deeper sub-sections

It's important to use headings in a logical order, creating a clear structure for your content.

### Example of Headings

```html
<h1>Main Title of the Page</h1>
<h2>Section 1</h2>
<h3>Subsection 1.1</h3>
<h2>Section 2</h2>
<h3>Subsection 2.1</h3>
<h4>Sub-subsection 2.1.1</h4>
```

## Lists in HTML

HTML offers two main types of lists: ordered and unordered.

### Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)

Ordered lists are used when the order of items is important. They are displayed with numbers or letters.

```html
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
```

### Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)

Unordered lists are used when the order of items doesn't matter. They are displayed with bullet points.

```html
<ul>
  <li>Item A</li>
  <li>Item B</li>
  <li>Item C</li>
</ul>
```

## Emmet for Faster HTML

Emmet is a toolkit that can greatly speed up your HTML writing. It uses simple abbreviations that expand into full HTML code.

### Emmet Examples

- `h1` + Tab expands to `<h1></h1>`
- `h2` + Tab expands to `<h2></h2>`
- `ul>li*3` + Tab expands to
```html
<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
```
- `ol>li*5` + Tab expands to
```html
<ol>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ol>
```

## Your Task

Create an HTML document that includes:

1.  An `<h1>` heading for the main title of the page.
2.  At least two `<h2>` headings for major sections.
3.  Use `<h3>` and `<h4>` headings within those sections.
4.  An ordered list with at least 4 items.
5.  An unordered list with at least 3 items.
6.  Use Emmet to generate the lists.

This task will help you practice using headings, lists, and Emmet for faster HTML writing.
